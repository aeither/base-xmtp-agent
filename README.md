### Environment variables

To run your XMTP agent, you must create a `.env` file with the following variables:

**Required:**
```bash
XMTP_WALLET_KEY= # the private key of the wallet
XMTP_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY= # a second random 32 bytes encryption key for local db encryption
XMTP_ENV=dev # local, dev, production
GROQ_API_KEY= # your Groq API key from https://console.groq.com
```

**Optional (for photo sharing feature):**

You need at least one of these storage services configured to use the `@photo` feature:

```bash
# Option 1: Pinata (IPFS)
PINATA_API_KEY= # your Pinata API key from https://pinata.cloud
PINATA_API_SECRET= # your Pinata API secret

# Option 2: Web3.Storage (IPFS)
WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN= # your Web3.Storage token from https://web3.storage
```

### Run the agent locally

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
# navigate to the folder
cd base-xmtp-agent
# install packages
pnpm install
# generate random xmtp keys (optional)
pnpm gen:keys
# run the agent
pnpm dev
```

### Usage

Once your agent is running, you can interact with it through XMTP:

**Ask about crypto prices:**
```
What's the price of bitcoin?
```

**Request a photo:**
```
Show me @photo
```
```
Can you send @photo?
```

**Send attachments:**
Send any file attachment to the agent, and it will:
- Download and decrypt it
- Extract the contents
- For text files, show a preview of the content

### Deploy to Railway

This project is configured for deployment on Railway:

1. Create a new project on [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Add the required environment variables in Railway's dashboard:
   - `XMTP_WALLET_KEY`
   - `XMTP_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
   - `XMTP_ENV`
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - Optional: `PINATA_API_KEY` and `PINATA_API_SECRET` or `WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN`
4. Railway will automatically detect the build configuration and deploy

The agent uses `pnpm` as the package manager and will build using `pnpm build` and start with `pnpm start`.
